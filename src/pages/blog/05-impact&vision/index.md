# Broader Impact
As a widespread group of motivated, culture-loving Europeans, we are all deeply concerned about the impact of COVID-19. Within the first few months of 2020, weâ€™ve already seen a rapid increase in the role video streaming plays in everyday life. The COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated how essential entertainment, virtual learning, video conferencing, telemedicine, and similar technologies are to continuity. These times clearly show us how important inclusion is. Many people in the world have special needs and simply cannot experience some activities (even without COVID-19).
NERVE can improve people's lives in many ways, not just in entertainment. You can immerse yourself in different cultures, visit historical places, take a walk in a distant city to enjoy its architecture, learn things directly from the sources of knowledge, and discover many other fascinating things.
Our app reconnects all, even in times of social-distancing, by offering unique and interactive online tours, education, adventures, experiences, stories and much more with the world, directed and powered by the consumers themselves. We are really excited to advance to the next stage.


# Vision
Nerve Global has the potential to heavily disrupt the overall societal structure and the exchange of values. For the first time, it is possible to collect values from independent actors and allocate them to a specific cause without the need of notary and legal enforcement. A democratic voting mechanism ensures that either all participants pay or none (depending on voting results).
Through the Nerve DApp, communities from around the globe are able to express their individual value perception and merge it into a value collection of unlimited size and allocate it to any cause of their liking.
This is a new form of a global and leaderless democracy in which the people decide where money is spent. It could revolutionize governance and pose a part of the solution for the upcoming problem of tax collection incurred by the obscure nature of blockchain transactions. We will be able to collect values for benevolent causes on a voluntary and individual basis and ensure the correct allocation of such values in a democratic fashion. We eliminate the need for third parties and bureaucracies when conducting charitable actions and events.
The linkage of the real-world implementation of IRL streaming and the digital realm of social media provides a solution to the divergence of digital and real-world communities. Through the Nerve DApp, we enable the ever-growing group of digital natives to influence real world proceedings. The progressive nature of digital natives might lead to a more robust value allocation towards environmental and climate-oriented projects.
